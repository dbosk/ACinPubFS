\section{Building Blocks}
\label{BuildingBlocks}

We will now describe the primitives and our assumptions upon which we will base
our constructions.
We start with a general file system, which is publicly readable and has no 
built in access control.
We then describe the general cryptographic primitives we need and finish with 
the \ac{ANOBE} scheme which we will use for part of our construction.
