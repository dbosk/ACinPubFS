\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we focus on achieving privacy-preserving access control 
  mechanisms for decentralized storage, primarily intended for an asynchronous 
  message passing setting.
  We propose two modular constructions, one using a pull strategy and the other
  a push strategy for sharing data.
  These models yield different privacy properties and requirements on the 
  underlying system.
  We achieve hidden policies, hidden credentials and hidden decisions.
  We additionally achieve what could be called \enquote{hidden policy-updates}, 
  meaning that previously-authorized subjects cannot determine if they have 
  been excluded from future updates or not.

\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
% XXX Rewrite the introduction

Alice and her friends want to communicate asynchronously.
To do this they want to use a publicly available file system and write their 
messages to different files, which the other party later can read.
This is a possible architecture for \iac{DOSN}.
We are interested in enforcing access-control policies in such a public file 
system which does not have any built-in access control mechanisms.
Our approach is to introduce a layer of encryption as a logical reference 
monitor.
Beyond the expected confidentiality, Alice wants some stronger privacy 
properties as well: her friends should not be able to monitor her activity, 
e.g.\ infer with whom else she communicates, even the fact that she 
communicates with others.

We will present an ideal model of communication and its desired properties in 
\cref{IdealCommunication}, this is what we want to achieve.
Then we will present the building blocks that we will use, and their 
accompanying assumptions, in \cref{BuildingBlocks}.
We will also assume a simple file system with no built-in access control.
This system is discussed and defined in \cref{FileSystem}.
This includes our adversary model: we will let the adversary control the file 
system.

Then we give two constructions that implement the functionality using different 
message-passing models and analyse what properties their primitives must have 
in \cref{PullAnalysis,PushAnalysis}.
The two message passing models are called the pull model and the push model.
In the pull model Alice's friends pull new messages from Alice, whereas in the 
push model Alice pushes new messages to her friends' inboxes.
The motivation is that the pull model is optimized for Alice and the push model 
for Alice's friends.
In a decentralized file system the pull model yields few connections for Alice,
but many for her friends (if they have more friends than Alice).
Conversely the push model yields many connections for Alice, but only one for 
her friends (they check their inbox).
In some situations connections can be expensive, cf.\ establishing many 
Tor~\cite{Tor} circuits to transfer little data and establishing one circuit to 
transfer more data.

After presenting our constructions we shortly analyse their algorithmic 
complexity in \cref{AlgComplexity}.
Finally we compare our results to related work in \cref{RelatedWork} and 
conclude by summarizing the main contributions and future work in 
\cref{Conclusions}.

\section{Related Work}\label{RelatedWork}

% XXX Formalize hidden policies, credentials and decisions --- but how?
%  - Hidden policies: policy-hiding ciphertext, how to formalize?
%    - Given two equally-sized ciphertexts the adversary cannot tell them 
%      apart?
%    - What about the size of the recipient set?  Padding and dummy entries 
%      should work?
%    - Probably the definition in [ANOBE] can help?
%    - Timing-attacks on the push model?  Alice writes n same-sized 
%      objects to n places within a short timespan.  How to formalize?
%  - Hidden credentials: the keys are by definition hidden, how to 
%    formalize?  In identity-based access control, is the identity itself 
%    the credential or whatever authenticates the identity?  Or both?
%  - Hidden decisions: the adversary should not be able to guess the 
%    outcome, an IND-style property.  This shouldn't be any problem to 
%    turn into a security game.

\citet{TowardsPPACwHPHCHD} identified three desirable and (conjectured 
sufficient) properties for a privacy-preserving \ac{AC} mechanism:
\begin{inparablank}
\item hidden policies,
\item hidden credentials, and
\item hidden decisions.
\end{inparablank}
The work in~\cite{TowardsPPACwHPHCHD} focused on \ac{FHE} and is thus not 
directly feasible for our purposes.
However, the properties are still relevant in our setting.

Hidden policies means that the access policy remains hidden from anyone but 
the owner and the subjects learn at most if they have access or not.
This is the same definition as we used above, and we arguably achieve this 
property in both of our constructions.
Furthermore, we also achieve what we call \enquote{hidden policy-updates} as 
well (Jealous Bob), which prevents previously-authorized subjects from 
determining whether they are no longer authorized to access newer versions.

%Let us briefly illustrate why the hidden policies property is important.
%Bob is not allowed access to an object, but he can see that Alice is.
%Then Bob can go to Alice and either ask her about it, or otherwise force her to 
%reveal it to him --- e.g.\ by stealing her keys.
%Even if Bob was allowed access to the object it is important that he does not 
%learn the policy.
%If Bob knows that Alice also has access to the object, then he can reveal the 
%object's contents to Eve and tell Eve to blame Alice for leaking the data to 
%her.
%But if Bob did not know who else has access, then he might be the only one and 
%thus less prone to leak to Eve as he is the only one to blame.

Hidden credentials means that the subject never has to reveal the access 
credentials to anyone.
In our case this is a cryptographic key, and as a consequence we allow the 
subject to anonymously read the ciphertext from the storage node.
This means that the storage node cannot track which subjects are requesting 
access to which objects.
%(If users are not anonymized, then the storage node can approximate the 
%credential, i.e.\ the subject's identity.)

Hidden decisions means that no-one but the subject must learn the outcome of an 
access request.
This means that no-one should learn whether or not a subject could decrypt the 
ciphertext or not.
However, if everyone only requests ciphertexts that they know they can decrypt 
(which is the most efficient strategy), then the storage operator can easily 
guess the decision.
Most solutions probably suffer from this, including our constructions.
This decision together with non-anonymized users would allow the storage 
operator to infer parts of the policy, hence breaking the hidden policy 
property.
To prevent this subjects could also request ciphertexts they cannot decrypt.
This can be done either by dummy requests (i.e.\ requesting objects at random) 
or by \ac{PIR} techniques, such as \ac{OT}.

%We have already high-lighted the relation between the pull model and \ac{BE}.
%The purpose of \ac{BE} is to develop methods to efficiently transmit data to 
%dynamically changing target audiences \(S\subseteq U\) who are allowed to read 
%the data, whereas the remaining users \(U\setminus S\) are not.
%Due to the modularity of our constructions any \ac{BE} scheme fulfilling the 
%properties could be plugged in and used instead of the \ac{ANOBE} scheme used 
%above.
%At the moment though, \ac{ANOBE} is the only known scheme that fulfils all 
%requirements.
%Also worthy of note is that none of the works in the \ac{BE} area has treated 
%the problem of hidden policy-changes.
%In fact, as is pointed out by \citet{ANOBE}, most research in \ac{BE} has been 
%focused on efficiency and not privacy (beyond confidentiality).

There is also related work in the \ac{DOSN} community.
There are several proposals available for \acp{DOSN}, e.g.\ 
DECENT~\cite{DECENT}, Cachet~\cite{Cachet} and Persona~\cite{Persona}.
The \ac{AC} mechanisms in these proposals focus on providing confidentiality 
for the data.
E.g.\ Persona uses \ac{KP-ABE} to implement the \ac{AC} mechanism and
unfortunately, this yields lacking privacy: as this is not policy-hiding, 
anyone can read the \ac{AC} policies and see who may access what data.
There are also general cryptographic \ac{AC} schemes that focus on achieving 
policy-hiding ciphertexts, see the section of related work 
in~\cite{TowardsPPACwHPHCHD}.
E.g.\ \citet{PEAC} adapted \ac{PE} for the \ac{AC} mechanism in \acp{DOSN}.
Works in this area that have employed policy-hiding schemes for \acp{DOSN} have
also focused on solving the problem of re-encryption of old data upon group 
changes.
We do not solve this problem, but rather contribute the insight that it would 
violate our desired privacy properties.
So besides being more efficient in some cases, less efficient in others, they 
do not require the same properties.


\section{Conclusions}\label{Conclusions}

We wanted to achieve privacy-preserving access control enforcement in a public 
file system lacking built-in access control.
We presented two alternatives: the pull and the push protocols.
Both implements the model of a publisher distributing a message to a set of 
subscribers.

The pull protocol achieves strong privacy properties.
It essentially inherits the ANO-IND-CCA property of its underlying \ac{BE} 
scheme.
The subscribers cannot learn who the other subscribers are even if they control 
the network of the file system or the whole file system.
Further, if the publisher wishes to exclude any of the subscribers from future 
publications, then all subscribers learn that there was a policy update but no 
one learns what changed --- not even those excluded!

The push model for communication is an interesting case.
Conceptually, the only difference between the push and pull models is that we 
distribute the message, instead of everyone fetching it.
This seems to yield better privacy properties at first glance, but it turns out
that we had to make considerable changes before we could get any security for 
the push protocol.
Hence the security guarantees are much weaker, we have to make some trade-offs.
One alternative is that the adversary can only control a part of the file 
system, or monitor only part of the network, this would make Eve's timing 
attacks more difficult.
Eve can still compute the distributions of messages over the inboxes and relate 
them, so we need some techniques to make this estimation more difficult.
However, unlike in the pull protocol, when the subscriber wants to make 
a policy update, none of the subscribers will even be notified that there has 
been a policy update --- let alone determine if they have been excluded.

As was pointed out in \cref{RelatedWork}, we do not treat group management 
(i.e.\ revoking the credentials for subjects) as is done in other schemes.
If the publisher excludes a subscriber, it is only from future publications ---
not from past!
In fact, we can conclude from our treatment above that such functionality would 
actually violate the privacy properties.
Even if possible, any subject could have made a copy anyway, i.e.\ it is the 
problem of removing something from the Web.
However, other group changes are easily done, the most expensive one is to give
a new subscriber access to old publications --- this requires re-encrypting or 
resending all publications.

%\subsection{Future Work}

An interesting future direction would be to explore Eve's limitations in the 
push protocol a bit more.
For example, under what conditions can Eve estimate the message distributions 
over the inboxes.
This would help us design an efficient scheme that can distort the 
distributions and guarantee security.

Both protocols are modular enough to provide better deniability, e.g.\ using 
a \ac{MAC} scheme for authentication of messages would remove the 
non-repudiation property.
To let all subscribers, and not only the publisher, publish messages.
Another interesting direction would be the opposite: stronger accountability.
An example of desired accountability would be that Bob wants to verify that 
Carol received the same message, if Alice told him that she sent a copy to 
Alice as well.
Due to the privacy properties this is not possible in the current protocols.
