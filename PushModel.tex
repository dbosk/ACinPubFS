\section{Construction and Analysis of the Push Protocol}
\label{PushAnalysis}

The idea of the push model is for each subscriber to have an inbox in the file 
system --- as opposed to the pull model, where the publisher has an outbox.
This is simply a file object with a randomly chosen identifier.
The publisher then puts all published material in the inbox of each subscriber.

We can see that if we simply put the broadcast ciphertext from the pull 
protocol in all inboxes, then Eve can relate them since they contain identical 
ciphertexts.
We thus have to make some more modifications.
We will use the protocol in the next definition in our analysis.

\begin{definition}[Push Protocol]\label{PushModel}
  Let \(\E = (\E[Keygen], \E[Enc], \E[Dec])\) be an AI-CCA encryption scheme,
  \(\S = (\S[Keygen], \S[Sign], \S[Verify])\) be a strongly unforgeable 
  signature scheme,
  and \(\FSop\) be a public file system.
  We denote by \(\Push[p, S]\) the \emph{push model protocol} implementing 
  a \((p, S)\)-communication model through the operations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\pnsetup[p, S]{p}[\cdot]\) and \(\pnsetup[p, S]{s}[\cdot]\),
    \item \(\pnpub[p, S]{p}[\cdot][\cdot]\), and
    \item \(\pnget[p, S]{s}[\cdot]\)
  \end{itemize}
  as in \cref{PushFunctions}.
\end{definition}

When Alice executes \(\pnsetup{p}\) it generates a signature-verification 
key-pair \((\SignKey{r}, \VerifKey{r})\) for every subscriber \(r\in S\) and 
gives the verification keys to all her friends.
Each of her friends \(r\in S\), when they execute \(\pnsetup{s}\) it generates 
a public-private key-pair.
Additionally they randomly choose a string as an identifier for their inbox.
They give the public key and the identifier to Alice.

When Alice wants to send a message \(m\) to a subset \(R\subseteq S\) of her 
friends, she uses \(\pnpub{p}\) to create a ciphertext \(c_r\) with signature 
\(\sigma_r\) for each friend \(r\in R\).
Then she uses \(\FS\) to append \(c_r\concat \sigma_r\) to the file with 
identifier \(i_r\).

The operation \(\pget{r}\) works similarly as in the Pull Model, however, it 
uses a different file.
It starts by reading the inbox from the file system.
Then it iterates through the list of entries, decrypting each entry.
Each entry, if successfully decrypted, is a new message.
It appends the message to the list of messages which it returns upon 
finishing.

Note that, similarly as for the pull protocol, the authentication scheme \(\S\) 
can be symmetric.
Here, the encryption scheme \(\E\) can also be a symmetric-key scheme, provided 
it is key-private.
We can simply let \(\PubKey{} = \PriKey{}\) and \(\SignKey{} = \VerifKey{}\) to 
achieve this.
This would yield private group communication with few key exchanges.
However, we use the notation of public-key cryptography in our abstraction.
This makes the push protocol modular as well.

Before we continue our analysis of what Eve can do against the push protocol, 
let us first look back at the pull protocol.
Imagine that Eve gets access to a publication oracle for an instance of the 
pull protocol, and remember that she controls the entire file system.
It is not hard to convince us that Eve cannot learn anything more from the file
system than she can from the ciphertext alone (when playing the ANO-IND-CCA 
game): each publication just appends the new ciphertext to the same file in the
file system --- no matter how she changes the recipient set.

Let us now look at what Eve can do in the push protocol.
Here she can actually learn information by observing the file system.
Whenever a message is published she learns which inboxes are used to get 
messages from the publisher, thus she can relate several inboxes.
Hence, for security analysis this protocol is only interesting to look at when 
run in parallel.

\subsection{Running Multiple Push Instances in Parallel}
\label{ParallelPush}

There is one issue we must consider before continuing our discussion of the 
security of the push protocol.
For the security discussion to make sense we must first, as for the pull 
protocol, convince ourselves that Eve cannot distinguish between parallel 
instances of the push protocol.
Thereafter we can continue our discussion of the security of the push protocol 
run in parallel.

We will give an information-theoretic argument for this.
Each encryption in \cref{PushFunctions} depends on the following:
the public key of the recipient, the signature key for the authentication, 
and the message.
Both the public key and the signature key is unique per recipient.
It follows that two encryptions of the same message are equally likely done 
within the same instance as in two different instances.
This follows from the security of the encryption scheme \(\E\).
Thus, Eve's only chance is to decide from the ciphertexts that they contain the 
same message, but since \(\E\) provides IND-CCA security this is possible only 
with negligible advantage.

Now we know that it makes sense to talk of the security when running parallel 
instances.
Assume that we run \(n\) instances of the push protocol in parallel.
It is not too difficult for Eve to distinguish which inboxes are related.
Eventually one instance will publish when no other instance is publishing.
Then that instance can be distinguished from others when publishing at the same
time, hence Eve can learn more and more over time --- even without using 
anything like the publication oracle mentioned earlier.
To deal with this problem, we will introduce a mix-net.

\begin{definition}[Mix-net]\label{MixNet}
  Let \(m_1, \ldots, m_k\) be messages from senders \(1, \ldots, k\).
  A mix-net is a functionality \(\M\) such that on inputs \(m_1, \ldots, m_k\) 
  the outputs \(\M[1](m_1), \ldots, \M[k](m_k)\) are unlinkable to its senders.
  More specifically \(\Pr[i\mid \M[i](m_i)] = \Pr[i] = \frac{1}{k}\).
\end{definition}

We note that by definition the mix-net will not output anything until the last
input slot has received input.

We will now assume that the calls to \(\FS\) in the push protocol 
(\cref{PushFunctions}) are replaced with 
\(\M_w[\cdot](\fswrite[\cdot][\cdot])\) and \(\M_r[\cdot](\fsread[\cdot])\), 
where \(\M_w\) and \(\M_r\) are two mix-nets for writing and reading 
operations, respectively.
The input slots are unique to each instance of the push protocol, instance 
\(i\) has input slot \(\M[i](\cdot)\).

Remember that the inbox identifier is randomly chosen, this means that the 
probability for an inbox being used by two instances is low.
Now, even with the mix-net Eve can distinguish which inboxes are related:
she can do this by looking at the distribution of the number of messages in the 
files in the file systems.
It is unlikely in practice that the behaviour of all publishers will be 
uniform, so Eve will eventually learn the related inboxes.
If Eve has access to a publication oracle as before, then she can do this much 
faster by publishing many times to the same recipient set.

To destroy this distribution each subscriber can reuse the inbox across 
instances for different publishers --- this is actually desirable for the push 
protocol also for efficiency reasons, the subscriber has only \emph{one inbox 
  for all} publishers.
This has the unfortunate effect that the publisher can determine that 
a subscriber subscribes to other publishers, i.e.\ a scenario related to 
Jealous Bob, but this time a Jealous Alice.
This in turn can be solved by adding noise to each inbox, thus making real 
messages indistinguishable from noise.
A more efficient solution would be for Bob to share an inbox with an 
\emph{unknown} other subscriber.
If not unknown, then Bob and the other subscriber can monitor each other's 
receiving distribution and knowing who it belongs to.
But Alice cannot determine if the other message are Bob's messages from Carol 
or Dana's messages from Felix.
This will reduce the amount of noise needed.

Finally we note that if Eve did not control the entire file system, she would 
not be able to relate inboxes that are not in the part she controls.
She would be able to read them, but the accuracy of her timing attacks would be
reduced to how often she could read the files to detect change.
This change of the adversary takes us from a decentralized setting with 
a network-wide adversary (or even a centralized setting) to a distributed 
setting where there is no network wide adversary, but an adversary controlling 
only a part of the network.
