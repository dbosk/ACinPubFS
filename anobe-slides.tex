% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.
